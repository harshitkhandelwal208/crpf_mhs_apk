# Worklog — CRPF MHS Wellbeing Platform

Adapting the requested FastAPI/Postgres/React-Vite stack to the **existing Next.js 16 environment** (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, Prisma+SQLite, z-ai-web-dev-sdk). The spirit of every requirement (RBAC, audit logging, AI abstraction, assessment engine, risk engine, voice, admin dashboard, security) is preserved.

Task ID: 0
Agent: orchestrator
Task: Inspect environment and plan the build.

Work Log:
- Confirmed Next.js 16.1.3 (Turbopack) running on port 3000, all shadcn/ui components present.
- Confirmed Prisma + SQLite at db/custom.db; z-ai-web-dev-sdk installed.
- Loaded LLM / ASR / TTS skill docs: `zai.chat.completions.create`, `zai.audio.asr.create({file_base64})`, `zai.audio.tts.create({input,voice,speed,response_format,stream})`.
- Decided architecture: single-route SPA (per env rule) with Zustand view-router; persistent Prisma models; AI/STT/TTS via Next.js API routes (server-only SDK); session-cookie mock auth with scrypt hashing; full RBAC + audit log.

Stage Summary:
- Ready to scaffold Prisma schema, types, constants, store, design system, then build pages + API routes.

Task ID: 5-B
Agent: full-stack-developer (auth pages)
Task: Build the 5 authentication view components (login, register, forgot-password, reset-password, verify-email).

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog + store/types/api/shared-ui/auth API routes to lock in exact patterns (`useApp`, `SafeUser`, `api.post` throwing `ApiRequestError{status,code}`, login route returning `{user}` with 401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS / 423 LOCKED).
- Confirmed `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `input-otp`, `framer-motion`, `sonner` all already in package.json; shadcn `card/button/input/label/checkbox/form/alert/tooltip/separator/input-otp/sonner` all present.
- Created `src/components/views/auth/` (new directory). The page.tsx dispatcher already lazy-imports the 5 view files, so no routing wiring was needed.
- Built a shared `AuthShell.tsx` helper (inside the auth folder, so no out-of-scope files touched) that renders the centered `max-w-md` Card over a calm teal split-gradient + hero-grid background with a soft radial glow and a framer-motion entrance. Also exports a `PasswordInput` (leading lock icon + Eye/EyeOff show/hide toggle, forwardRef so it drops into FormField) and a `PasswordStrength` meter (on-brand teal, red only for "weak").
- LoginView: email + password (PasswordInput) + remember-me checkbox, forgot-password link inline, "or" divider, disabled "Continue with Google" wrapped in Tooltip ("OAuth available in production deployment"). On submit POST /api/auth/login → setUser → if !onboardingComplete navigate assessment else dashboard. Distinguishes 401 (inline field error) vs 423 LOCKED (prominent destructive Alert). Includes the dev-credentials callout (dashed muted Alert, password `Sentinel@2025`, clickable emails that auto-fill the form).
- RegisterView: name / email / password (min 8 + live strength meter) + optional Service Number / Rank / Unit in a 3-col grid. zod validates email + min length. POST /api/auth/register → setUser → navigate assessment. Maps 409/EMAIL_TAKEN to inline email error. Includes a teal privacy Alert linking to the privacy view and a "what you're signing up for" footnote. No DOB / no sensitive ID beyond service number.
- ForgotPasswordView: email field, optimistic 650ms delay → success state ("If an account exists for that email, a reset link has been sent.") with the submitted address and a subtle note that outbound email is not wired in this preview. Link back to login.
- ResetPasswordView: new-password + confirm-password with zod refine (must match, min 8). On submit (mocked token) → success toast + navigate login. Includes a "Token validation is mocked in this preview" note.
- VerifyEmailView: informational page with a MailCheck badge, shadcn `InputOTP` 6-digit input (size-12 slots, centered), Verify button (enabled only when 6 digits entered), resend-code action, and a production-note Alert. On verify → success toast → route to assessment/dashboard/login based on the current `user` from the store.
- Ran `bun run lint` scoped to `src/components/views/auth` — zero errors. (The two pre-existing `no-require-imports` errors in `src/lib/auth.ts` & `src/lib/audit.ts` are from earlier agents and outside this task's scope.) Dev log shows no auth-view compile errors; the only module-not-found is for other agents' pending public views (e.g. PrivacyView).

Stage Summary:
- Files created (all inside `src/components/views/auth/`):
  - `AuthShell.tsx` — shared centered-card layout + calm teal split background, framer-motion entrance, `PasswordInput` (show/hide), `PasswordStrength` meter, `scorePassword`.
  - `LoginView.tsx` — login form, locked-account handling, dev-credentials callout, disabled Google+tooltip.
  - `RegisterView.tsx` — registration form with strength meter + optional service fields + privacy note.
  - `ForgotPasswordView.tsx` — optimistic reset-request flow (no real email claim).
  - `ResetPasswordView.tsx` — new-password + confirm with zod match refine, mocked token.
  - `VerifyEmailView.tsx` — 6-digit OTP mock verify with production note.
- Design: calm teal palette (bg-primary/text-primary), centered max-w-md cards, hero-grid + radial-glow background, responsive (3-col → 1-col service fields, mobile-safe touch targets ≥36px), accessible (Form labels, aria-invalid, sr-only descriptions, focus-visible rings, role=alert on Alerts), framer-motion entrance, no indigo/blue.
- Notes for downstream agents: the register backend route (`POST /api/auth/register`) referenced by RegisterView is not yet present in the repo — a backend agent should implement it returning `{ user: SafeUser }` and setting the session cookie (email-collision → 409 EMAIL_TAKEN is handled gracefully on the client). Forgot/reset/verify are intentionally client-only mocks per the task spec.

Task ID: 5-A
Agent: full-stack-developer (public pages)
Task: Build the 7 public-facing view components (landing, about, how-it-works, resources, support, contact, privacy).

Work Log:
- Read worklog, store, types, constants, api, shared UI primitives (logo, level-pill, ui), public navbar/footer, globals.css design tokens, and confirmed the 7 lazy-import slots in src/app/page.tsx that point at my view files.
- Skimmed the existing API routes (resources, emergency-contacts, support) to match request/response shapes exactly (ResourceDTO, EmergencyContactDTO, SupportRequestDTO, support-type enum).
- Reviewed the available shadcn/ui components in src/components/ui (card, button, badge, accordion, dialog, input, textarea, label, select, separator, skeleton, sonner).
- Built LandingView.tsx (home): hero with hero-grid bg + trust badges + dual CTAs; 6-card features grid with framer-motion fade-in; warm amber "Need immediate help?" panel; 3-step how-it-works preview with "See full process" CTA; privacy & trust section with 4 pillar cards; final teal CTA band.
- Built AboutView.tsx: mission + "who it's for" card row; explicit "Sentinel is / is not" two-column comparison (emerald vs rose); 4 principle cards (least privilege, explicit consent, audit logging, human escalation); footer CTA.
- Built HowItWorksView.tsx: 7-step vertical stepper with numbered badges + lucide icons (step 6 carries "Operational, not diagnostic" badge); 6-question FAQ accordion covering AI diagnosis, journal visibility, anonymity, crisis, consent withdrawal, commander access.
- Built ResourcesView.tsx: GET /api/resources with retry, skeleton loading grid, EmptyState, category chips (merges RESOURCE_CATEGORIES with any extras present in data) + search input, keyboard-accessible resource cards opening a Dialog with full body + tags + source.
- Built SupportView.tsx: GET /api/emergency-contacts with retry; prominent warm amber "Need immediate help?" card; support-contact cards each showing label/description/contact/hours; auto-detects emergency contact (label or 24/7 hours) and tags it with id="emergency-contact" so landing-page "Emergency Assistance" CTA can deep-link via params.focus; inline support-request form (Select for type + Textarea for message) for logged-in users that POSTs to /api/support with sonner toasts; non-diagnosis disclaimer; org-config note.
- Built ContactView.tsx: react-hook-form + zodResolver + zod schema (name/email/subject/message); since no email backend is wired, simulates 600ms submission then shows success toast + resets; includes side panel that routes to Support for wellbeing concerns.
- Built PrivacyView.tsx: prominent amber "Sentinel is not anonymous" honesty disclaimer; 4 pillar overview cards; 8-section accordion (what we collect, why, how used, who can access, retention, sensitive data protection, consent, rights) with sticky TOC on lg+; policy version badge from CONSENT_VERSION constant.
- Ran eslint + tsc on the 7 public view files — all clean. Pre-existing errors in AdminAnalyticsView.tsx and lib/{audit,auth}.ts are unrelated to this task.
- Wrote per-task record at /home/z/my-project/agent-ctx/5-A-public-pages.md summarising patterns observed, design decisions, validation results, and notes for downstream agents.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (all under src/components/views/public/): LandingView.tsx, AboutView.tsx, HowItWorksView.tsx, ResourcesView.tsx, SupportView.tsx, ContactView.tsx, PrivacyView.tsx.
- Key decisions: calm teal palette only (no indigo/blue); amber used for "immediate help" panels (warm, non-screaming, not red); mobile-first responsive; full accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard nav, focus-visible rings, aria-invalid on form fields); framer-motion limited to subtle scroll-reveal fade-ins on the landing features grid; sonner toasts for the contact + support-request flows; deep-linking via useApp().params so the landing "Emergency Assistance" button focuses the emergency contact card on the Support page; no real phone numbers invented — SupportView only renders what the API returns.
- The dev.log still shows Module not found errors for app/admin/auth views that other agents haven't created yet — those are NOT caused by my changes; once the other view files land, the lazy imports in src/app/page.tsx will resolve cleanly and the public pages will render end-to-end.

Task ID: 7
Agent: full-stack-developer (admin pages)
Task: Build 8 admin console view components (dashboard, personnel, person detail, risk, alerts, analytics, audit-logs, settings).

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md, store.ts, types.ts, constants.ts, api.ts, level-pill.tsx, ui.tsx, admin-shell.tsx, and the 7 admin API route contracts.
- Created `_shared.tsx` helper inside `src/components/views/admin/` with: `AdminPage`, `RiskFootnote`, `RestrictedNotice`, `AuditedBadge`, `StatusBadge`, `SupportStatusBadge`, `PermissionNotice`, `ErrorPanel`, `SkeletonCard`, `relTime`/`fmtDate`/`fmtDateTime`. (Kept inside admin folder per "do not modify outside `src/components/views/admin/`" rule.)
- AdminDashboardView: 6 stat cards w/ lucide icons + tinted rings, recharts BarChart of risk distribution (LEVEL_META colors), Recent Alerts mini-table (links to admin-alerts and admin-person), Personnel Requiring Attention list (fetches HIGH + CRITICAL from /api/admin/personnel). VIEW_ANALYTICS-gated with PermissionNotice.
- AdminPersonnelView: debounced search, unit + level Select filters, paginated table (desktop) ↔ cards (mobile), LevelDot for indicator, status badges, row → admin-person. Honors `params.q`/`params.unit`/`params.level` as initial filters.
- AdminPersonView: header w/ role/status/onboarded badges; latest risk + 14-event sparkline BarChart; alerts list w/ LevelPill + StatusBadge; support requests; gated Assessment History, Journals, Voice Transcripts, AI Conversations (each marked with AuditedBadge when visible, RestrictedNotice otherwise). Right column: profile facts + at-a-glance counts (counts hidden for restricted sections).
- AdminRiskView: filter by unit/level/days (7/14/30/60/90), horizontal BarChart distribution, alert-trend LineChart, recent alerts table, summary tiles, RiskFootnote.
- AdminAlertsView: filter by status/severity, table (desktop) ↔ cards (mobile), DropdownMenu row actions (view personnel, assign-to-me, set status), PUT `/api/admin/alerts/[id]` with sonner toast, pagination.
- AdminAnalyticsView: stat tiles, donut PieChart of risk distribution, per-unit stacked BarChart (normal vs elevated), 14-day 4-series LineChart (journals/assessments/voice/chats). VIEW_ANALYTICS-gated.
- AdminAuditView: read-only Collapsible rows w/ expandable JSON metadata, action filter (common actions list from AUDIT_ACTIONS), pagination, "System audit log — sensitive actions recorded here" banner.
- AdminSettingsView: platform info, environment card (AI_PROVIDER shown only if NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER, secrets never exposed), consent version, full RBAC permission matrix table (roles × permissions, sensitive perms highlighted), dev seed-regenerate button gated by AlertDialog confirmation.
- Ran `bun run lint` — all 8 admin views + `_shared.tsx` clean. (2 pre-existing `no-require-imports` errors remain in `src/lib/audit.ts` & `src/lib/auth.ts` — out of scope.)

Stage Summary:
- Files created in `src/components/views/admin/`: `_shared.tsx`, `AdminDashboardView.tsx`, `AdminPersonnelView.tsx`, `AdminPersonView.tsx`, `AdminRiskView.tsx`, `AdminAlertsView.tsx`, `AdminAnalyticsView.tsx`, `AdminAuditView.tsx`, `AdminSettingsView.tsx`.
- All views are `"use client"`, default-exported, take no props, use `useApp` for navigation/params/user, handle loading/error/empty states, and use sonner toast for actions.
- Permission gating is double-layered (client `hasPermission` + backend `visible` flags / 403s). Sensitive sections clearly marked "Sensitive — access audited". Risk views carry the "internal operational indicators, not clinical diagnoses" footnote. Calm teal palette throughout — no indigo/blue. Charts use recharts with LEVEL_META dot hex colors.
- Work record at `/home/z/my-project/agent-ctx/7-full-stack-developer-admin-pages.md`.

Task ID: 6
Agent: full-stack-developer (app pages)
Task: Build 9 authenticated user view components (assessment, dashboard, daily-log, voice-journal, ai-companion, history, profile, help, settings).

Work Log:
- Read worklog, store, types, constants, api, shared UI, app-shell, and every API route contract (dashboard, assessments current/history, journals + [id], voice/transcribe, ai/chat, ai/analyze-journal, ai/conversations, support, consent, tts).
- Inspected globals.css (calm teal palette) and the shadcn/ui component set (card, button, textarea, tabs, progress, slider, radio-group, dialog, alert-dialog, badge, avatar, select, switch, scroll-area, accordion, separator, label, input, skeleton, tooltip).
- Created 9 view files in src/components/views/app/:

  1. AssessmentView.tsx (view: assessment) — calm intro screen → fetches /api/assessments/current, renders one question per screen with Progress bar, radio-card options, Back/Skip/Next navigation. POST /api/assessments on final question. Server computes score; UI shows only "Your check-in has been recorded." After submit, refreshes user via /api/auth/me so onboardingComplete flips, then renders reassurance completion screen with disclaimer and "Go to dashboard". Re-take path when user.onboardingComplete already true.

  2. DashboardView.tsx (view: dashboard) — GET /api/dashboard. Time-of-day greeting + firstName. Mood selector (MOODS) row. Quick journal composer (Textarea + mood + Save Draft / Submit Entry → POST /api/journals). Quick-actions grid (Daily Log, AI Companion, Voice Journal, Assessment, History, Resources, Get Support). 4 stat cards (streak, check-ins, journals, voice notes). Recent activity list (journals/voice/conversations previews → navigate). needsOnboarding banner prompting assessment. Internal risk score NEVER shown. Loading skeleton + error retry.

  3. DailyLogView.tsx (view: daily-log) — two-column responsive layout. Left: composer (MoodPicker + Textarea + Save Draft / Submit Entry → POST /api/journals). Right: scrollable history list (GET /api/journals) with mood emoji, date/time, status Badge, preview, Edit + Delete actions. Edit via Dialog (PUT /api/journals/[id]). Delete via AlertDialog confirmation (DELETE /api/journals/[id]). Privacy note about wellbeing-signal analysis. Loading/empty/error states.

  4. VoiceJournalView.tsx (view: voice-journal) — big primary record button (Start Speaking) → MediaRecorder (auto-selects webm/opus → webm → mp4 → ogg). Recording timer (mm:ss), pulsing mic indicator (.rec-pulse), Stop button. On stop: blob → dataURL → POST /api/voice/transcribe { audio, mime, durationSec }. Shows "Transcribing…" spinner. Then review phase with EDITABLE Textarea prefilled with transcript; Submit (POST /api/journals) or Cancel. NEVER auto-submits. Graceful mic-permission errors (NotAllowedError, NotFoundError). Privacy note. Recent voice notes from /api/dashboard. Mobile-first big tap targets.

  5. AICompanionView.tsx (view: ai-companion) — full-height chat layout. Left sidebar: conversation list (GET /api/ai/conversations) + New chat button. Main: header, scrollable messages with user-right/assistant-left bubbles, typing indicator (.typing-dot), auto-scroll. Empty state with suggested prompts. Input box: Textarea (Enter to send, Shift+Enter newline) + mic button (MediaRecorder → /api/voice/transcribe → fills input for review) + send button (POST /api/ai/chat). On response: optimistically renders user msg + pending assistant bubble, replaces with real response. Speak button on assistant messages → POST /api/tts (returns WAV blob) → plays via new Audio(). riskFlag → amber support panel above composer with "Get support now" → support. Disclaimer "AI-assisted companion — not a clinician, not a diagnosis." Mobile-friendly sidebar hidden on small screens.

  6. HistoryView.tsx (view: history) — Tabs: Journals | Voice | Check-ins | Chats. Each tab fetches its source (GET /api/journals, GET /api/dashboard for voice, GET /api/assessments/history, GET /api/ai/conversations). Renders list of cards with formatted dates, status badges, mood emojis, previews. Empty states with CTAs to the corresponding view. NEVER exposes internal wellbeing level — assessment tab shows only "Check-in recorded on [date]" with explicit privacy note.

  7. ProfileView.tsx (view: profile) — Identity card (avatar, name, email, status badge, role label, MFA badge) + 6-field info grid (service number, unit, rank, email, member since, last login). Cards: Password (form disabled, "Coming soon"), MFA (Switch + Coming soon), Sessions (mock current session), Notifications (ToggleRow switches), Data preferences (toggles). Consent management card: GET /api/consent → list with granted/withdrawn status per purpose (assessment, journal_processing, voice_processing, ai_processing). Grant/Withdraw buttons → AlertDialog confirmation → POST /api/consent { purpose, status } → reload. Consent history list. Privacy policy link.

  8. HelpView.tsx (view: help) — Quick-link cards (Resources, Support, Profile, Privacy). Searchable FAQ accordion (8 questions covering privacy, AI limitations, support flow, data deletion, wellbeing level, crisis, anonymity, cost). Contact support card with 3 contact channels (24/7 line, email, crisis text) + "Open support" CTA.

  9. SettingsView.tsx (view: settings) — Appearance card: theme picker (Light/Dark/System) wired to store.setTheme, font-size slider (Small/Default/Large/Extra large) applying via document.documentElement.style.fontSize, accessibility toggles (Reduce motion, High contrast) applying CSS classes. Notifications card with 5 ToggleRow switches persisted to localStorage. Privacy & data card linking to privacy policy + manage consent (profile). Used lazy useState initializers (no setState-in-effect lint violation).

Stage Summary:
- Files created (all in src/components/views/app/):
  - AssessmentView.tsx (424 lines)
  - DashboardView.tsx (370 lines)
  - DailyLogView.tsx (320 lines)
  - VoiceJournalView.tsx (340 lines)
  - AICompanionView.tsx (370 lines)
  - HistoryView.tsx (270 lines)
  - ProfileView.tsx (490 lines)
  - HelpView.tsx (200 lines)
  - SettingsView.tsx (310 lines)
- All 9 files lint cleanly (`bun run lint`). Only 2 pre-existing lint errors remain, both in src/lib/audit.ts (require()) and src/lib/auth.ts (require()) — outside my scope, untouched.
- Design: calm teal palette (bg-primary/text-primary) — NO indigo/blue. Mobile-first responsive (stacks on small screens, two-column grids on sm/lg). Accessibility: ARIA labels on every interactive control, aria-pressed on toggle buttons, sr-only legends, focus-visible rings, ≥44px tap targets on voice/chat inputs.
- Never-expose risk level: the dashboard, daily-log composer, history (assessments tab), and AI companion all deliberately omit any reference to the internal wellbeing score/level — only authorized roles in admin views see indicators.
- Disclaimers: "AI-assisted wellbeing system — not a medical diagnosis" appears on AssessmentView (intro + completion) and AICompanionView (empty state + composer footer).
- Loading/error/empty states everywhere: Spinner / FullSpinner / EmptyState from @/components/shared/ui, custom Skeleton layouts for dashboard/daily-log/history/voice/ai-companion. Toasts via sonner for all async feedback.
- Notes for downstream agents: the home route currently 500s because AdminAuditView.tsx imports @/lib/audit which uses next/headers (server-only). That is a separate (Task 7) fix. My app views have no such imports — they only touch API routes via @/lib/api.

Task ID: 3-fix
Agent: full-stack-developer (api route error wrapping)
Task: Wrap all API route handlers with apiRoute so ApiRequestError statuses (401/403/404/422) reach clients instead of becoming 500.

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog + `src/lib/api-shared.ts` (the new `apiRoute<A>(fn)` wrapper that catches `ApiRequestError` and returns `jsonError(message, status, code)`, with a catch-all that returns 500 for any other error) + `src/lib/auth.ts` (`requireAuth` throws `ApiRequestError("Authentication required", 401, "UNAUTHENTICATED")`; `requirePermission` throws `ApiRequestError("You do not have permission...", 403, "FORBIDDEN")` after writing an `unauthorized_access_attempt` audit entry).
- Applied the prescribed mechanical transform to every exported handler in `src/app/api/**/route.ts`:
  - `export async function METHOD(...)` → `async function _METHOD(...)` (drop `export`, prefix `_`, body UNCHANGED).
  - Appended `export const METHOD = apiRoute(_METHOD);` at end-of-file for each handler.
  - Added `apiRoute` to the `@/lib/api-shared` import (merged into existing `{ jsonError }` imports where present; new import line added where the file did not already import from there).
  - Preserved `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";` and all other code untouched.
  - For dynamic `[id]` routes (`journals/[id]`, `admin/personnel/[id]`, `admin/alerts/[id]`), the second `params` arg was preserved verbatim: `async function _GET(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> })`.
- Files converted (26 files, 30 handlers total):
  - auth: `login` (POST), `logout` (POST — inline `await import("next/headers")` left as-is), `me` (GET)
  - journals: `journals` (GET, POST), `journals/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - assessments: `assessments` (GET, POST), `assessments/history` (GET)
  - voice: `voice/transcribe` (POST)
  - ai: `ai/chat` (POST), `ai/analyze-journal` (POST), `ai/conversations` (GET)
  - support/resources/contacts/consent: `support` (GET, POST), `resources` (GET), `emergency-contacts` (GET), `consent` (GET, POST)
  - misc: `dashboard` (GET), `tts` (POST), `seed` (POST)
  - admin: `admin/dashboard` (GET), `admin/personnel` (GET), `admin/personnel/[id]` (GET), `admin/risk` (GET), `admin/alerts` (GET), `admin/alerts/[id]` (GET, PUT), `admin/audit-logs` (GET), `admin/analytics` (GET)
- NOTE: `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` is listed in the task spec but the file does not exist in the repo (the `register/` directory is empty). Per Task 5-B worklog, the register backend route has not been implemented yet. Per the task rule "Do NOT touch any other files" / "Do NOT change any logic inside the function bodies", I did not create a new register route — when a future backend agent implements it, they should wrap with `apiRoute` from the start.
- `bun run lint` clean (zero errors). Pure mechanical transform — no logic, imports (other than adding `apiRoute`), or other files were touched.

Verification results (dev server started in background, curls run against `http://127.0.0.1:3000`):

```
================ USER (expected all 403) ================
login(user): 200
  dashboard:   403
  personnel:   403
  risk:        403
  alerts:      403
  audit-logs:  403
  analytics:   403

================ ADMIN (expected all 200) ================
login(admin): 200
  dashboard:   200
  personnel:   200
  risk:        200
  alerts:      200
  audit-logs:  200
  analytics:   500   ← pre-existing Prisma bug, NOT caused by this task

================ USER /api/admin/dashboard body ===============
{"error":"You do not have permission to perform this action.","code":"FORBIDDEN"}

================ Sanity: non-admin routes still work for USER ================
  /api/dashboard:            200
  /api/journals:             200
  /api/assessments/history:  500   ← same pre-existing Prisma bug
  /api/ai/conversations:     200
  /api/consent:              200
  /api/support:              200
  /api/resources:            200
  /api/emergency-contacts:   200
```

- The RBAC fix is verified end-to-end: a USER hitting any `/api/admin/*` endpoint now gets `403 {"error":"You do not have permission to perform this action.","code":"FORBIDDEN"}` (was 500 before the wrap). The 403 body matches exactly what `requirePermission` throws via `ApiRequestError`.
- ADMIN gets 200 on 5/6 admin endpoints; the 6th (`/api/admin/analytics`) returns 500 due to a PRE-EXISTING Prisma field-name bug in the route body — it queries `db.assessmentSession.findMany({ where: { createdAt: ... } })` but the `AssessmentSession` Prisma model only has `startedAt` (no `createdAt`). The same bug also affects `/api/assessments/history`. These are runtime Prisma validation errors, NOT `ApiRequestError`s — the new `apiRoute` wrapper behaves exactly as designed: it catches the non-`ApiRequestError` exception, logs `[api] unhandled error:`, and returns a JSON 500 with the Prisma error message. The bug itself (wrong field name) is outside Task 3-fix's scope ("Do NOT change any logic inside the function bodies") — flagged for a future backend-fix task.

Stage Summary:
- 26 route files / 30 handlers mechanically wrapped with `apiRoute` from `@/lib/api-shared`.
- `bun run lint` clean (zero errors introduced).
- RBAC fix confirmed: USER → 403 on all `/api/admin/*` endpoints (was 500). Body is JSON `{error, code:"FORBIDDEN"}` rather than Next.js's opaque 500 HTML page.
- ADMIN access preserved on 5/6 admin endpoints (200). 6th (`/api/admin/analytics`) returns 500 due to a pre-existing Prisma `createdAt`-vs-`startedAt` field bug in the route body — outside this task's scope, correctly caught and JSON-encoded by the new `apiRoute` wrapper (logs `[api] unhandled error:` + returns JSON 500).
- `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` confirmed absent from the repo — left for the future backend agent that will implement register (they should wrap handlers with `apiRoute` from the start).
- Detailed per-file record at `/home/z/my-project/agent-ctx/3-fix-full-stack-developer-api-route-error-wrapping.md`.
